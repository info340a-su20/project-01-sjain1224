            <p>
                Small Businesses are vital parts of our community. They are locally owned shops, some often being owned by generations of a family.
                They are also a huge part of the economy! In fact, as of 2018, 99.7% of all businesses are small businesses. They create jobs for 
                almost 59 million workers and tend to be more customer/community centric and give back to their local community. For more on how
                small businesses are important to local communities, check out

                However, COVID-19 has hit these small businesses hard. A lot are struggling to hang on right now due to the lack of business.
                In a survey of 275 small business owners, 94% of owners reported negative impacts due to COVID-19, with restaurants and retail
                being the hardest hit. In fact, a majority of them are seeking government financial assistence and half are worried about what
                will happen to their business in the next 6 months (for all these numbers and more, go to

                People have been trying to support these vital businesses by going out and making their purchases at these places. People order to-go
                at restaurants, purchase gift cards to places like bookstores and theaters, and do grocery shopping at family-owned stores. However,
                sometimes its hard to know what local businesses are in the area. Maybe you haven't had time to go to some of them. In other times,
                you are wondering if they are open for to-go, what their hours are and such. There is no one place someone can go to find out how they 
                can support all local businesses while also knowing information about the business.
